                <p>Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....</p>
                <p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works...showing things that never were nor could be.</p>

                        <h3>I'm Joe Cowman, a software engineer from Omaha, Nebraska.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Computers have fascinated me for most of my life. 
                            I put that quote by Fred Brooks at the top of this page because it does a great job explaining why I fell in love with building software. 
                            My dad, an architect, first exposed me to programming when I was in elementary school―and I've basically been obsessed ever since.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started out making drag-and-drop games in GameMaker Studio. 
                            In middle school, I was building Pong clones in Flash.
                            I spent my sophomore year of high school teaching myself Python, and I knew that I was meant to be a software engineer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now I'm in my third year at the University of Nebraska―Lincoln, where I'm studying for a Bachelor's in Computer Science through the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management.
                            I've had <a class="paragraph-link" href="#experience">several internships so far</a>, which have been incredibly valuable.
                            I plan to go into the industry after I graduate, either working for a tech company that excites me, or starting my own.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my free time, you can often find me hacking on <a class="paragraph-link" href="#projects">one of my personal projects</a>, making music, or spending time with the people I love.
